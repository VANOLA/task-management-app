# Overview #

The Track-It application's objective is to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for managing tasks
and assignments. TrackIt allows user's to create a personalized account to track their to-do's and manage their tasks efficiently.
Upon login, user's gain access to a dashboard where they can create, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can be categorized into 
separate lists and prioritized. They can also be given due dates. A separate *Today* page shows users tasks that are due today.
